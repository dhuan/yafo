## Playground

The little project inside the `playground` folder provides a exemplary `create-react-app` based app of Yafo. It's useful if you want to quickly try out Yafo and play around with its features without having to install it anywhere. The following commands need to be run in order to set up the playground:

```sh
npm run playground:build
npm run playground:start
```

With that, you should be able to try out Yafo by accessing localhost:3000.
